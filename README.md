# Parking-Spaces-Counter-Project
Parking-Spaces-Counter-Project
This system takes input of an aerial view of a parking lot and shows which spaces are empty and displays the total empty spaces.
We train an images of the parking lot to mark the 'regions of interests' (parking spaces) and store that data.
That data is used to test the video of the parking lot taken over time to display free/taken parking spcaes.

Image training example:
